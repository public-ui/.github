# Welcome to KoliBri

**KoliBri** stands for Component Library for the Accessibility 

## Vision

We make **HTML** accessible using **reusable web components** to ensure **usability** and **accessibility**.

## Mission

The [HTML Web Standard](https://www.w3.org/html) is intrinsically specified to be very "open" in order to be as durable and robust as possible. It is therefore common that HTML compositions are not readily accessible, semantic and valid.
KoliBri builds directly on the [Web Standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/) of the [W3C](https://www.w3.org) (framework-agnostic), is thereby a generic reference implementation of the [WCAG Standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and the [BITV](https://www.bitvtest.de/bitv_test.html) for accessibility and is implemented as a multi-theme-enabled presentation layer. There is no subject-related reference and no data transfer functionalities. This makes KoliBri equally reusable for the realization of static web pages as well as dynamic web applications of different corporate designs and style guides and therefore very interesting for open source.

## Collaboration and Cooperation

The **focus** of KoliBri is on **small** (atomic), very **flexible** and well **reusable** HTML compositions (e.g. button). We provide an accessible, semantic and valid standard implementation of such components that can be reused for any higher-level HTML structure or component (molecule, organism or template).

For these atomic components, we should **collaborate** and **cooperate** to pool our skills and knowledge. Synergy at the basic components will allow our own focus to be more on subject-specific content.

To this end, let **us** **together** make KoliBri **better** and **more** colorful!
